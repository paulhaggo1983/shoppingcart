## How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Run the application (F5).
3. A console window will display the URLs/ports the application is listening on (for example: https://localhost:7216/). or http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
4. Copy the URL into your browser.
5. Add `/swagger` to the end of the URL. If needed

Note
6. I have compiled the exe as debug also (Swagger will run, IsDev has been commented out), If you would just like to run that
\in-tend_product_shop_cart_sampl\bin\Debug\net9.0\in-tend_product_shop_cart_sampl.exe
